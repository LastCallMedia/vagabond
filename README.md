Vagabond Development Environment
================================

This is a development tool to help in setting up a docker powered development stack.  It was built to help Last Call Media transition from a Vagrant development stack to a Docker one.  It's mostly useful for OSX users, although Linux users might eventually find it helpful too.

It assumes the following:

- [ ] You are working on websites
- [ ] You have a directory containing one or more websites that you want to serve
- [ ] You require persistent data that shouldn't go away when your containers are destroyed.
